Design of cascode amplifier and cascode current mirror in schematic and layout using 
LTspice or Cadence and Magic/Cadence tools in 180 nm (supply 1.8 V) technology and 
only schematic of cascode amplifier, beta multiplier and cascode current mirror in 22 nm 
(supply 0.8 V) technology node to see the effect of lowering the technology node.
